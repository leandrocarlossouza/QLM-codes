**SQQNN - Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Network**

Overview

SQQNN is a Python implementation of quantum-inspired neural networks based on the methods proposed in "Regression and Classification with Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Networks" (
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.09486). This implementation adapts the single-qubit quantum neural network architecture for classical hardware while preserving key quantum-inspired properties.

**Key Features**

  Implementation of the single-qubit quantum neural network architecture described in  Souza et al.

  Quantum circuit simulation with parameterized rotation gates.
  
  Measurement and state collapse operations.
  
  Hybrid quantum-classical optimization approach.
  
  Support for both regression and classification tasks.

**Requirements**

  Python 3.7+
  
  NumPy
  
  Matplotlib (for visualization)
  
  scikit-learn (for datasets and evaluation)
